Make sure your goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).</p>\n<p>Break down larger goals into smaller, actionable steps with realistic deadlines.</p>\n<h4 id=\"d2gou\"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Assess Your Current Financial Situation</strong></h4>\n<p>Evaluate your current income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Determine how much you can realistically afford to save each month after covering essential expenses. Also consider debt payments, and other financial obligations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1dln3\"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Calculate Savings Targets</strong></h4>\n<p>Determine how much money you need to save each month to reach your financial goals within your desired timeframe. Use online calculators or create a spreadsheet to estimate the amount you need to save based on your goals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a0r11\"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Create a Budget</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/budgeting/\">Develop a realistic budget</a> that outlines your income, expenses, and savings goals. Allocate a portion of your income towards savings each month. Ensure that you&#8217;re setting aside enough money to achieve your financial objectives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4894k\"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Choose Savings Vehicles</strong></h4>\n<p>Consider options such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), or brokerage accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/\">nairaCompare</a> has <a href=\"https://app.nairacompare.ng/savings/personal-savings-account\">a rich pool of savings accounts</a> you can choose from.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1qvkh\"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Automate Your Savings</strong></h4>\n<p>Set up automatic transfers or contributions from your checking account to your savings accounts. Automating your savings can help you stay disciplined and consistent with your savings plan, ensuring that you&#8217;re regularly setting aside money towards your goals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3u1q0\"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Track Your Progress</strong></h4>\n<p>Monitor your progress towards your savings goals regularly. Review your budget, savings accounts, and financial goals periodically to ensure you&#8217;re on track to achieve your objectives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"50h1e\"><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Review and Adjust as Needed</strong></h4>\n<p>Review your savings plan regularly and make adjustments as needed, based on changes in your income, expenses, or financial goals.</p>\n<p>Be flexible and adaptable, and be willing to modify your plan to accommodate unforeseen circumstances or changes in priorities.</p>\n<p>By following these steps and staying committed to your personal savings plan, you can build a strong financial foundation, achieve your financial goals, and work towards a secure and prosperous future.</p>\n<h4 id=\"5af3b\"><strong>Supercharging Your Personal Savings Plan for Financial Freedom</strong></h4>\n<p>Supercharging your personal savings plan for financial freedom involves maximising your savings potential, optimising your investments, and taking proactive steps to achieve your financial goals efficiently.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the ultimate guide to help you supercharge your personal savings plan:</p>\n<h4 id=\"2bs5\">● <strong>Maximise Your Income</strong></h4>\n<p>Look for opportunities to <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/savings/top-10-best-savings-apps-based-on-customer-rating/\">increase your income</a>. This could be negotiating a raise, taking on additional work or freelance projects, or exploring passive income streams like rental properties or investments.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fjj5b\">● <strong>Reduce Expenses</strong></h4>\n<p>Review your expenses and identify areas where you can cut back or reduce spending. Consider adopting frugal habits, shopping smartly, and eliminating unnecessary expenses to free up more money for savings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"5ut15\">● <strong>Build an Emergency Fund</strong></h4>\n<p>Establish an emergency fund with enough savings to cover three to six months&#8217; worth of living expenses. Start small and gradually increase your savings until you reach your target emergency fund amount.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fljt9\">● <strong>Invest Wisely</strong></h4>\n<p>Explore investment options that align with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.</p>\n<p>Consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and mutual funds. By doing this, you can minimize risk and maximize returns.</p>\n<h4 id=\"38to0\">● <strong>Stay Motivated</strong></h4>\n<p>Focus on your financial goals by tracking your progress, celebrating milestones, and visualising the benefits of achieving financial freedom. Surround yourself with supportive friends, family, or mentors who can encourage and inspire you along the way.</p>\n<p>By following these steps and staying committed to your personal savings plan, you can supercharge your savings and move closer to achieving financial freedom and security.</p>\n<h2 id=\"406n3\"><strong>Why Having an Emergency Fund is Essential in Your Savings Plan</strong></h2>\n<p>Having an emergency fund is a fundamental aspect of financial planning and an essential component of your savings plan.</p>\n<p>Here are some reasons why an emergency fund is essential in your savings plan:</p>\n<h4 id=\"d2l2c\">● <strong>Financial Security</strong></h4>\n<p>An emergency fund provides a financial safety net to cover unexpected expenses or emergencies, such as medical bills, car repairs, home maintenance, or job loss. Having a cash reserve can help you avoid financial hardship and prevent you from going into debt to cover unforeseen costs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cfp4m\">● <strong>Peace of Mind</strong></h4>\n<p>Knowing that you have a cushion of savings to fall back on in times of need can provide peace of mind and reduce stress. Instead of worrying about how you&#8217;ll cover unexpected expenses, you can focus on finding solutions and managing the situation effectively.</p>\n<h4 id=\"evar8\">● <strong>Avoiding Debt</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/savings/step-by-step-guide-how-to-build-an-emergency-fund/\">Emergency funds</a> can help you avoid resorting to high-interest payday loans or other forms of debt to cover unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>By using cash reserves from your emergency fund, you can avoid accumulating debt and the associated interest charges and fees.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dcert\">● <strong>Maintaining Financial Independence</strong></h4>\n<p>Having an emergency fund can help you maintain financial independence and autonomy. You don’t have to rely on others for financial assistance or support during challenging times, allowing you to preserve your dignity and self-reliance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7e9kn\">● <strong>Protecting Long-Term Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>An emergency fund can protect your progress towards long-term financial goals, such as saving for retirement, buying a home, or funding education expenses. Without an emergency fund, unexpected expenses or emergencies can derail your plans and set you back financially.</p>\n<h4 id=\"93i79\">● <strong>Funding Opportunities</strong></h4>\n<p>Having cash reserves available in <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/savings/personal-savings/emergency-fund/\">your emergency fund</a> can also provide opportunities for investment or taking advantage of favourable financial opportunities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a3ksd\">● <strong>Cushioning Against Income Loss</strong></h4>\n<p>An emergency fund can provide a buffer against temporary income loss, such as job loss or reduced hours. Having savings to cover essential expenses can help you bridge the gap until you&#8217;re able to secure alternative income sources or find a new job.</p>\n<p>By prioritising your emergency fund in your savings plan, you can achieve greater financial stability and resilience to navigate life&#8217;s unexpected challenges.</p>\n<h4 id=\"28tkj\"><strong>Personal Savings In Entrepreneurship</strong></h4>\n<p>Personal savings are an important source of <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/top-10-best-banks-for-business-accounts-in-nigeria-2024/\">startup financing</a> for many entrepreneurs who are just starting out.</p>\n<p>Using personal savings to finance a startup can be a great way to jumpstart the business and get it off the ground without relying on outside investors or lenders.</p>\n<p>Personal savings play a crucial role in entrepreneurship, especially in the early stages of starting a business.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how personal savings can impact entrepreneurship:</p>\n<h4 id=\"7161u\">● <strong>Seed Capital</strong></h4>\n<p>Personal savings often serve as the primary source of seed capital for entrepreneurs. Using personal funds to finance startup costs, such as business registration fees, initial inventory purchases, or equipment expenses, allows entrepreneurs to launch their businesses without relying on external financing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"5vlq6\">● <strong>Risk-Taking</strong></h4>\n<p>Entrepreneurs who invest their savings into their businesses demonstrate confidence in their ventures and are more willing to take calculated risks.</p>\n<p>Personal savings allow entrepreneurs to experiment, pivot, and adapt their business models as needed without external pressure from investors or lenders.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ffh2q\">● <strong>Control and Autonomy</strong></h4>\n<p>By using personal savings to finance their businesses, entrepreneurs can retain full control and autonomy over their ventures.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t have to answer to investors or lenders and can make decisions based on their own vision, values, and goals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"d6mll\">● <strong>Bootstrap Funding</strong></h4>\n<p>Bootstrapping, or self-funding, is a common strategy among entrepreneurs who rely on personal savings to cover startup costs and operating expenses. Bootstrapping allows entrepreneurs to operate leanly, minimise overhead costs, and focus on generating revenue without taking on debt or giving up equity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"f8o4p\">● <strong>Proof of Commitment</strong></h4>\n<p>Using personal savings to <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/business-loans/how-to-get-a-small-business-loan-in-nigeria/\">fund a business</a> demonstrates a strong commitment to its success. Investors, partners, and stakeholders may view personal investment as a positive signal of the entrepreneur&#8217;s dedication and determination to make the business succeed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7sfmc\">● <strong>Financial Stability</strong></h4>\n<p>Personal savings provide a financial safety net for entrepreneurs, especially during periods of uncertainty or financial challenges. Having savings to fall back on can help entrepreneurs weather downturns, cover unexpected expenses, and sustain their businesses during difficult times.</p>\n<h4 id=\"rjv6\">● <strong>Sustainability</strong></h4>\n<p>Building a business with personal savings encourages financial discipline and responsible spending habits. Entrepreneurs are more likely to prioritize cost-effective strategies, focus on revenue generation, and seek sustainable growth opportunities to ensure the long-term success and viability of their businesses.</p>\n<p>While personal savings can be a valuable resource for entrepreneurship, it&#8217;s essential for entrepreneurs to carefully consider the risks and trade-offs associated with using their own funds.</p>\n<p>If you are ready to take your financial security to the next level, you can take advantage of nairaCompare’s range of <a href=\"https://app.nairacompare.ng/savings/personal-savings-account\">personal savings accounts</a>.</p>\n<p><!-- strchf script --><script>if(window.strchfSettings === undefined) window.strchfSettings = {};window.strchfSettings.stats = {url: \"https://nairacompare.storychief.io/en/personal-savings-plan?id=523050110&type=2\",title: \"What is a Personal Savings Plan?\",siteId: \"4702\",id: \"dd4301e4-fa02-4b1b-87c4-71a478c8464d\"};(function(d, s, id) {var js, sjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) {window.strchf.update(); return;}js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"https://d37oebn0w9ir6a.cloudfront.net/scripts/v0/strchf.js\";js.async = true;sjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sjs);}(document, 'script', 'storychief-jssdk'))</script><!-- End strchf script --></p>\n","raw":null},"excerpt":{"protected":false,"rendered":"<p>If one of your goals for 2024 is to achieve financial security, then a personal savings plan is your roadmap to achieving that goal.

A business plan is a formal document that outlines the goals of your business and how you plan to achieve them.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s a roadmap for your business, essential for both internal planning and external purposes, such as securing funding from investors or loans from banks.</p>\n<p>In addition to attracting investors or securing financing, a business plan is also a valuable tool for guiding the growth and development of the business.</p>\n<p>It helps entrepreneurs clarify their vision, identify potential challenges, and develop strategies for overcoming them.

Explain what sets your business apart from competitors and why it&#x27;s uniquely positioned for success in the market.</p>\n<h4 id=\"c4kpv\">● <strong>Market Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>Conduct thorough market research to analyse the size, growth potential, trends, and dynamics of your target market.</p>\n<h4 id=\"n6g6\">● <strong>Value Proposition</strong></h4>\n<p>Clearly articulate your value proposition and how your products or services address the needs and pain points of your target customers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cbbc5\">● <strong>Marketing and Sales Strategy</strong></h4>\n<p>Outline your <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/business-loans/5-things-to-know-before-securing-a-business-loan-in-nigeria/\">marketing and sales strategy</a> for acquiring customers, generating leads, and driving revenue growth.</p>\n<p>Describe your pricing strategy, distribution channels, promotional tactics, and customer acquisition plans. Provide detailed projections for customer acquisition costs, conversion rates, and revenue forecasts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2s0qc\">● <strong>Operational Plan</strong></h4>\n<p>Describe the operational aspects of your business, including your business model, production process, supply chain management, and quality control measures.</p>\n<p>Outline your organizational structure, key personnel, and staffing requirements. Discuss any regulatory or legal considerations that may impact your operations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9uvc7\">● <strong>Financial Projections</strong></h4>\n<p>Develop detailed financial projections for your business, including income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets.</p>\n<p>Provide realistic and conservative estimates for revenue, expenses, and profitability over the next three to five years. Include key financial metrics such as gross margin, net profit margin, break-even analysis, and return on investment (ROI).</p>\n<h4 id=\"c7ion\">● <strong>Funding Requirements</strong></h4>\n<p>Clearly state your funding requirements and how the funds will be used to support the growth and expansion of your business. Specify the amount of funding you are seeking, the purpose of the funds, and the expected milestones or targets that will be achieved with the investment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9c8su\">● <strong>Risk Management</strong></h4>\n<p>Identify potential risks and challenges facing your business and outline strategies for mitigating and managing these risks. Address factors such as market volatility, competitive threats, regulatory compliance, operational risks, and financial constraints. Demonstrate your ability to adapt and navigate challenges effectively.</p>\n<h4 id=\"c2216\">● <strong>Exit Strategy</strong></h4>\n<p>Provide an exit strategy for investors, outlining how they can expect to realize a return on their investment in the future. Discuss potential exit options such as IPOs, acquisitions, or strategic partnerships, and highlight the potential valuation and timing of such events.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7pda8\">● <strong>Professional Presentation</strong></h4>\n<p>Ensure that your business plan is professionally formatted, well-written, and visually appealing.

Proofread your plan carefully to eliminate any errors or inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>Remember to tailor your business plan to the specific needs and preferences of your target audience and be prepared to answer questions and provide additional information as needed during the due diligence process.</p>\n<h4 id=\"abh48\"><strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Writing a Business Plan</strong></h4>\n<p>Writing a business plan is a critical step for any entrepreneur seeking funding or <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/business-loans/lending-terms/\">looking to build a successful business</a>.</p>\n<p>However, there are several common mistakes that entrepreneurs often make when writing their business plans.</p>\n<p>Here are some key mistakes to avoid:</p>\n<h4 id=\"25v5p\">● <strong>Neglecting Market Research</strong></h4>\n<p>Failing to conduct thorough market research is a common mistake. Entrepreneurs should understand their target market, customer needs, industry trends, and competitive landscape to position their business effectively and identify potential opportunities and challenges.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7f9ul\">● <strong>Overlooking the Competition</strong></h4>\n<p>Ignoring or underestimating the competition is another mistake to avoid. As an entrepreneur, you should conduct a competitive analysis to identify key competitors, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and determine how their business will differentiate itself in the marketplace.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bqa1o\">● <strong>Ignoring the Financials</strong></h4>\n<p>Neglecting to include detailed financial projections and analysis in the business plan is a critical oversight. Investors and lenders want to see realistic revenue forecasts, expense estimates, profit margins, and cash flow projections to assess the financial viability and potential return on investment of the business.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dabfk\">● <strong>Exaggerating or Misrepresenting Information</strong></h4>\n<p>Providing inaccurate or inflated information in the business plan can damage credibility and trust with investors. Be honest and transparent about the business&#x27;s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks. Avoid making unrealistic claims or promises that cannot be substantiated.</p>\n<h4 id=\"8s8eh\">● <strong>Neglecting to Address Risks and Mitigation Strategies</strong></h4>\n<p>Every business faces risks and challenges, and investors want to know that entrepreneurs have considered potential obstacles and have plans in place to mitigate them. Include a risk management section in the business plan that identifies key risks and outlines strategies to minimize their impact.</p>\n<p>By avoiding these common mistakes and taking the time to create a well-researched, clearly articulated, and compelling business plan, entrepreneurs can increase their chances of attracting funding, building a successful business, and achieving their goals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"8i93e\"><strong>10 Reasons Every Entrepreneur Needs a Solid Business Plan</strong></h4>\n<p>A business plan is <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/business-loans/top-10-business-ideas-for-women-in-nigeria-2024/\">a valuable tool for entrepreneurs</a> and business owners that provides clarity, direction, and strategic guidance for the organisation.</p>\n<p>It helps attract funding, identify opportunities, mitigate risks, and ultimately, drive the company&#x27;s success.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 reasons why having a business plan is important:</p>\n<h4 id=\"8712v\"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Clarifies Business Goals and Objectives</strong></h4>\n<p>A business plan helps define the company&#x27;s mission, vision, goals, and objectives.

It helps entrepreneurs make informed decisions about resource allocation, marketing strategies, expansion plans, and other critical aspects of the business.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bbs1r\"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Identifies Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h4>\n<p>Through the process of creating a business plan, entrepreneurs conduct a thorough analysis of their business idea, market opportunities, competition, and internal capabilities. This helps identify the company&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, allowing for better strategic planning and risk management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4ddag\"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Attracts Investors and Lenders</strong></h4>\n<p>A comprehensive business plan is essential for attracting investors, lenders, and potential partners. It demonstrates the viability of the business concept, outlines the potential return on investment, and provides assurance to stakeholders about the company&#x27;s growth prospects.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9ht9r\"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Secures Funding</strong></h4>\n<p>A well-written business plan is often required when <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/business-loans/business-loan-application/\">seeking funding from banks</a>, venture capitalists, angel investors, or other sources of financing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7vces\"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Defines Target Market and Customers</strong></h4>\n<p>A business plan includes market research and analysis to identify the target market, customer demographics, buying behaviours, and competitive landscape. This information helps businesses tailor their products or services to meet the needs of their target audience more effectively.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bre64\"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Facilitates Strategic Planning</strong></h4>\n<p>A well-thought-out business plan serves as a strategic planning tool, enabling businesses to set clear objectives, develop actionable strategies, and allocate resources efficiently.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9h9q1\"><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Monitors Progress and Performance</strong></h4>\n<p>Business plans include key performance indicators (KPIs) and milestones that allow entrepreneurs to monitor the company&#x27;s progress and performance over time. Regularly reviewing and updating the business plan helps identify areas of improvement and adjust strategies as needed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fqbe7\"><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Minimises Risks</strong></h4>\n<p>By conducting thorough market research and financial analysis, businesses can identify potential risks and challenges early on and develop contingency plans to mitigate them. A well-prepared business plan helps minimize risks and improves the chances of success.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9muul\"><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Promotes Accountability and Focus</strong></h4>\n<p>Having a business plan promotes accountability and focus among team members by providing a clear roadmap and set of goals to work towards.

Fixed income funds<a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/mutual-funds-fixed-income-funds/\"> </a><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/mutual-funds-fixed-income-funds/\">invest in bonds</a>, which are debt securities that pay a fixed rate of return. These funds typically offer higher returns than money market funds, but they also carry more risk. Money market funds invest in short-term, low-risk securities such as<a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/fixed-deposit/fixed-deposit-vs-treasury-bills-which-is-better/\"> </a><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/fixed-deposit/fixed-deposit-vs-treasury-bills-which-is-better/\">government treasury bills</a> and certificates of deposit. As a result, money market funds offer lower returns than fixed income funds, but they are also less risky.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arn28\"><strong>Investment Horizon</strong></h3>\n<p>Another key difference between fixed income funds and money market funds is their investment horizon. Fixed income funds are for long-term investors who are willing to hold their investments for several years. These funds typically invest in bonds with maturities of five years or more. Money market funds, on the other hand, are for short-term investors who need access to their funds quickly. These funds typically invest in securities with maturities of less than one year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ai9i\"><strong>Liquidity</strong></h3>\n<p>Fixed income funds and money market funds also differ in their liquidity. Fixed income funds are less liquid than money market funds because they invest in longer-term securities that may be harder to sell quickly. As a result, investors in fixed income funds may face challenges if they need to sell their investments quickly. Money market funds, on the other hand, are highly liquid because they invest in short-term securities that can be easily sold. As a result, investors in money market funds can access their funds quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>In summary, fixed income funds and money market funds differ in their risk and return profiles, investment horizon, and liquidity. Fixed income funds offer higher returns but are more risky and less liquid than money market funds. Money market funds offer lower returns but are less risky and more liquid than fixed income funds. It is important for investors to consider their investment goals and risk tolerance when choosing between these two types of funds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5grns\"><strong>Choosing the Right Option</strong></h2>\n<p>When choosing between a<a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/fixed-income-fund/\"> </a><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/fixed-income-fund/\">Fixed Income Fund</a> and a<a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/what-is-money-market-fund/\"> </a><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/general/what-is-money-market-fund/\">Money Market Fund</a>, investors should consider several key factors. These include investment goals, risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and liquidity needs.</p>\n<p>For investors seeking a stable income stream, a Fixed Income Fund may be the better option. These funds invest in bonds and other fixed-income securities, which typically offer higher yields than money market funds. However, they may also be subject to greater price fluctuations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Money Market Funds invest in short-term, low-risk securities such as treasury bills and certificates of deposit. They are generally considered to be very safe investments, but they also offer lower yields than fixed income funds.</p>\n<p>Risk tolerance is another important factor to consider. Investors who are comfortable with potential fluctuations may prefer a Fixed Income Fund. Those who are more risk-averse may prefer a Money Market Fund.</p>\n<p>Investment timeframe is also important. Fixed Income Funds are typically better for long-term investors, while Money Market Funds are more appropriate for short-term investors.</p>\n<p>Finally, liquidity needs should be taken into account. Money Market Funds are generally more liquid than Fixed Income Funds, meaning investors can access their funds more quickly.</p>\n<p>To help guide investors in their decision-making process, the following table summarizes the key differences between Fixed Income Funds and Money Market Funds:</p>\n<p><strong>Factor</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"embed strchf-type-embed regular strchf-size-regular strchf-align-center\">\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"airtable-embed\" src=\"https://airtable.com/embed/appAxfRS45xYNGroN/shrUbQ9zANDFHgohl\" frameborder=\"0\" onmousewheel=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"533\" style=\"background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;\"></iframe></div>\n</figure>\n<p>By considering these factors and using the table as a guide, investors can make an informed decision about which type of fund is right for them.</p>\n<p>Looking to invest in a Fixed Income fund or Money Market Fund and you don’t know where to start?

Fixed Income Funds offer higher potential returns and are ideal for those with a longer investment horizon and a higher risk tolerance. On the other hand, Money Market Funds provide a safe haven for investors looking to preserve their capital while earning a modest return.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that both options have their unique features and risks, and investors should carefully consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before making a decision. Furthermore, investors in the Nigerian market should be aware of the specific market conditions and regulations that may affect their investment decisions.</p>\n<p>Investors are encouraged to conduct further research and seek advice from financial advisors to determine which option is best suited for their individual needs and circumstances. With careful consideration and expert advice, investors can make informed decisions that will help them achieve their financial goals.</p>\n<p><!-- strchf script --><script>if(window.strchfSettings === undefined) window.strchfSettings = {};window.strchfSettings.stats = {url: \"https://nairacompare.storychief.io/en/fixed-income-fund-money-market-fund?id=785835858&type=2\",title: \"Fixed Income Fund vs Money Market Fund\",siteId: \"4702\",id: \"dd4301e4-fa02-4b1b-87c4-71a478c8464d\"};(function(d, s, id) {var js, sjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) {window.strchf.update(); return;}js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"https://d37oebn0w9ir6a.cloudfront.net/scripts/v0/strchf.js\";js.async = true;sjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sjs);}(document, 'script', 'storychief-jssdk'))</script><!-- End strchf script --></p>\n","raw":null},"excerpt":{"protected":false,"rendered":"<p>Fixed income funds and money market funds are two popular investment options that investors can choose from.

Confusion between these two tax types is common, since they both involve deducting amounts from payments. However, they differ significantly in how they function. Getting this distinction right can impact an organization&#x27;s cash flow, record-keeping requirements, and overall tax liability.</p>\n<p>This article will clarify what sets VAT and withholding taxes apart through concise definitions and comparisons of their key attributes. A strong grasp of these two tax types empowers taxpayers to implement accurate accounting treatment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"84gsd\"><strong>What is VAT?</strong></h2>\n<p>Value-added tax (VAT) is a consumption tax that gets collected incrementally across every stage of the supply chain. This is from production to point of sale, whenever value is added to a good or service. It ultimately gets passed on in full to the consumer but does not become an actual cost for businesses that collect it.</p>\n<p>The standard VAT rate in Nigeria is 7.5% as of 2020. When companies buy goods or services from their suppliers, they pay VAT on their purchases. Later, when those companies sell products to their own customers, they charge those buyers VAT.</p>\n<p>The aim is to tax the value added by companies at each stage. For example, when a fruit supplier sells produce to a jam manufacturer, the manufacturer pays VAT on the total value of fruits purchased. Then when the manufacturer sells jam to stores, it charges VAT based on the value added in turning raw fruit into jam. Stores collect VAT from consumers on the full jam sales price when shoppers buy it. So the consumer bears the final VAT burden, while businesses in the supply chain facilitate transferring it to the government. VAT therefore brings in tax revenue to fund public services and infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6rh7k\"><strong>What is Withholding Tax?</strong></h2>\n<p>Withholding tax, often abbreviated as WHT, is an income tax that is collected at the source of payment before funds are disbursed to the recipient. It requires the payer to deduct a designated percentage of the amount due to another party. Then, pay that amount directly to the tax authorities on the income earner&#x27;s behalf.</p>\n<p>For example, when a company pays out interest, dividends, rents, royalties, or certain services fees, it must withhold a flat 10% tax on those payments to Nigerian residents. The company deducts the 10% tax from the total payment amount and remits only the remaining 90% to the contracting party. This withheld tax is essentially a prepayment against the eventual income tax liability of the individual or company receiving the income.</p>\n<p>Rather than relying on recipients to accurately report taxable income, tax agencies mandate that payers perform this upfront deduction. This makes it easier to identify tax liabilities and improves enforcement. Withholding tax is thus primarily a mechanism to increase efficiency of tax collection on investment income or cross-border transactions. It often applies to foreign investors or non-resident companies without permanent establishments in Nigeria.</p>\n<p>While the withholding obligation falls on the payer transmitting funds, the actual tax burden belongs to the recipient on whose behalf income tax is prepaid in this manner. Payers must file returns documenting taxes withheld and amounts dispersed. Withholding does not represent a final tax figure. Recipients can offset advance withholding amounts against their overall income tax bill for the year. They may claim refunds if excess tax was withheld beyond actual liability. Or conversely, if insufficient tax was withheld relative to total tax obligation at year-end, recipients owe the balance directly to tax authorities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fao51\"><strong>Key Differences Between VAT and Withholding Tax</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"embed strchf-type-embed regular strchf-size-regular strchf-align-center\">\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"airtable-embed\" src=\"https://airtable.com/embed/appAxfRS45xYNGroN/shr2rCVOdWziIdCIK\" frameborder=\"0\" onmousewheel=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"533\" style=\"background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;\"></iframe></div>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"3dbsn\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In summary, even though both VAT and withholding taxes involve deducting amounts from payments, they operate quite differently in terms of point of collection, responsible taxpayer, purpose and tax base. VAT incrementally pools government revenue across the entire supply chain until the final sale, with the burden ultimately falling on consumers.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, withholding taxes facilitate income tax collection directly from the original payer. Keeping these key differences straight will benefit companies in achieving tax compliance and individuals in understanding tax burdens.

However, with the nation&#x27;s inflation rate soaring to an alarming <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/668583-updated-nigerias-inflation-hits-29-9-amid-high-food-prices.html\">29.9% as of February 2024</a>, a burning question arises: Does the current inflation substantially diminish the real value of your fixed deposit investment?</p>\n<p>Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services, effectively reducing the purchasing power of your money over time. As prices rise, the same amount of cash buys fewer goods and services. This begs the question: Can your fixed deposit returns keep pace with this erosion of purchasing power?</p>\n<h2 id=\"cjimt\"><strong>How Inflation Impacts Fixed Deposit Returns</strong></h2>\n<p>To grasp the true impact of inflation on your fixed deposit earnings, it&#x27;s essential to understand the concept of the &quot;real interest rate.&quot; The real interest rate is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate (the advertised rate on your fixed deposit).</p>\n<p>For example, if your fixed deposit offers a nominal interest rate of 10% but the inflation rate is a staggering 29.9%, your real return would be a negative 19.9%. In other words, despite earning a double-digit nominal return, the value of your investment is actually decreasing due to the soaring cost of living.</p>\n<p>Even positive nominal returns can lose significant purchasing power over time due to sustained high inflation. This underscores the importance of considering the real interest rate when evaluating the long-term performance of your fixed deposit investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4gn70\"><strong>Long-Term vs. Short-Term Impacts</strong></h2>\n<p>The erosive effect of inflation on fixed deposit returns is compounded over longer investment tenures. If you have a fixed deposit with a multi-year term, the real value of your investment could be substantially diminished by the time you receive your principal and interest.</p>\n<p>Shorter-term fixed deposits may fare slightly better, as the impact of inflation is less severe over a shorter time frame. However, even these investments are not immune to the potential loss of value resulting from high inflation rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evoij\"><strong>Protecting Your Investment Against Inflation</strong></h2>\n<p>While fixed deposits offer safety and guaranteed returns, their inability to outpace inflation can be a cause for concern. To protect your investments from the ravages of inflation, you may want to consider alternative options with the potential for inflation-beating returns. Here are some possibilities to explore:</p>\n<h3 id=\"bi0pp\"><strong>1. Treasury Bills</strong></h3>\n<p>Treasury bills, also known as risk-free government securities, often offer higher yields than traditional fixed deposits. These short-term investment instruments are backed by the full faith and credit of the Nigerian government, making them a relatively low-risk option.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/savings/treasury-bills\">The current yields on Nigerian Treasury bills</a> range from around 7% for 91-day bills to over 10% for 364-day bills. These rates have the potential to outperform inflation, depending on the prevailing economic conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3ud8g\"><strong>2. Stocks</strong></h3>\n<p>Investing in well-performing companies with pricing power can generate returns that outpace inflation over the long term. Companies with strong brand recognition and the ability to pass on cost increases to consumers are often better positioned to maintain their profit margins in inflationary environments.</p>\n<p>While the stock market can be volatile in the short term, historical data suggests that equity investments have consistently outperformed inflation over extended periods. Diversifying your stock portfolio across various sectors and industries can help mitigate risk while capitalizing on growth opportunities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8vid9\"><strong>3. Real Estate</strong></h3>\n<p>Property values tend to appreciate alongside inflationary pressures, preserving your investment&#x27;s purchasing power. As inflation drives up the cost of construction materials and labor, the value of existing real estate assets typically increases correspondingly.</p>\n<p>Investing in income-generating properties, such as rental apartments or commercial buildings, can provide a dual benefit: not only do the property values appreciate, but rental income can also be adjusted upwards to keep pace with inflation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9dqc1\"><strong>4. Commodities</strong></h3>\n<p>Certain commodities, such as precious metals (gold, silver) and energy resources (oil, natural gas), have historically served as effective inflation hedges. As the prices of consumer goods and services rise, the demand for these commodities often increases, driving up their value.</p>\n<p>Investing in commodity-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds can provide exposure to this asset class without the logistical challenges of directly holding physical commodities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"93qc5\"><strong>5. Diversification</strong></h3>\n<p>Diversifying your portfolio across various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities, can help mitigate the risk of inflation. By allocating your investments across different sectors and industries, you can reduce your overall exposure to any single asset class&#x27;s performance.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s important to note that higher-yielding options, such as stocks and commodities, may come with higher levels of risk. Therefore, it&#x27;s crucial to align your investment strategy with your individual risk tolerance and financial goals. Consulting with a professional financial advisor can help you develop a tailored portfolio that balances growth potential with risk management.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s worth considering indexing a portion of your portfolio to inflation-linked instruments, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or inflation-indexed bonds. These investment vehicles are designed to adjust their principal and interest payments based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), providing a direct hedge against inflation.</p>\n<p>By diversifying your investments and exploring alternative options with the potential for inflation-beating returns, you can better position your portfolio to preserve and grow your wealth, even in the face of rising inflationary pressures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8fag3\"><strong>Key Considerations Before Adjusting Investments</strong></h2>\n<p>Before making any significant changes to your investment portfolio, it&#x27;s essential to carefully consider your personal financial objectives and risk tolerance. While fixed deposits may not provide inflation-beating returns, they still offer safety and guaranteed returns, which can be valuable depending on your investment horizon and risk appetite.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s also advisable to seek professional financial advice from a qualified advisor. They can help you develop a tailored investment strategy that balances your desire for growth with your need for capital preservation, taking into account the prevailing economic conditions and your unique circumstances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5lnai\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In the face of Nigeria&#x27;s current high inflation rate, it&#x27;s clear that traditional fixed deposit investments may struggle to preserve the real value of your savings over time.

While a payday loan might seem like a quick solution, it&#x27;s important to understand the rules before you take one out.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting a Payday Loan on Your First Job</strong></p>\n<p>Qualifying for a payday loan on your first job can be challenging, as lenders typically prefer borrowers with a stable employment history and regular income.</p>\n<p>You might be able to get a payday loan even if you just started a new job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/payday-loans/top-10-payday-loans-online/\">Payday lenders in Nigeria</a> typically focus on verifying that you have a steady income source, not necessarily the length of time you&#x27;ve been employed.</p>\n<p>They may accept a recent job offer letter or proof of your upcoming paycheck as income verification.</p>\n<p>However, even though obtaining a payday loan might be possible, it&#x27;s strongly recommended to avoid them.</p>\n<p>However, if you&#x27;re determined to pursue this option, here are some steps you can take to improve your chances of qualifying:</p>\n<p>● <strong>Find a Lender That Accepts First-Time Employees</strong></p>\n<p>Research online or visit local payday loan stores to inquire about their policies for first-time employees.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Provide Proof of Employment</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you’re yet to receive your first pay cheque, you can still provide proof of employment to demonstrate your income stability.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Have a Valid Bank Account</strong></p>\n<p>Ensure that you have an active bank account in your name before applying for a payday loan.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Provide Identification Documents</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/payday-loans/ussd-code-for-payday-loans-in-nigeria-2022/\">Payday lenders</a> typically require borrowers to provide identification documents to verify their identity and prevent fraud.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Check Your Credit Score</strong></p>\n<p>Check your credit score and report to ensure that there are no errors or issues that could affect your payday loan application.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives to Consider Before Taking Out a Payday Loan as a New Employee</strong></p>\n<p>If you just started a job, it is important to carefully consider the risks and explore alternative options before resorting to a payday loan.</p>\n<p>There might be better solutions available to help you <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/payday-loans/top-10-loans-for-federal-workers-in-nigeria/\">manage your finances</a> until your first paycheck arrives</p>\n<p>Here are some alternatives to consider:</p>\n<p>● <strong>Borrowing from Friends or Family</strong></p>\n<p>If you need short-term financial assistance, consider borrowing from friends or family members who may be willing to lend you money without charging interest or fees.</p>\n<p>Be sure to establish clear repayment terms and stick to them to maintain healthy relationships.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Credit Union Loans</strong></p>\n<p>Credit Unions often offer more affordable and flexible lending options compared to traditional banks or payday lenders.</p>\n<p>Consider applying for a personal loan or line of credit from a credit union, which may offer lower interest rates, longer repayment terms, and more favourable terms for borrowers.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Side Hustles</strong></p>\n<p>Explore opportunities to increase your income by taking on a side hustle or part-time job outside of your regular employment.</p>\n<p>Use the additional income to supplement your earnings and improve your financial situation.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Personal Loans</strong></p>\n<p>While not ideal, <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/personal-loans/top-10-personal-loans-in-nigeria/\">applying for a personal loan</a> from a bank or online lender may be a more affordable option compared to payday loans.</p>\n<p>Be sure to compare interest rates, fees, and repayment terms carefully before borrowing.</p>\n<p>Avoid taking on more debt than you can afford to repay, and prioritise building a strong financial foundation for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips for Managing Payday Loans as a New Employee</strong></p>\n<p>Managing payday loans as a freshly hired employee requires careful budgeting, financial planning, and responsible borrowing practices to avoid falling into a cycle of debt.</p>\n<p>Some tips for effectively managing payday loans may include:</p>\n<p>● <strong>Understand the Terms:</strong></p>\n<p>Familiarise yourself with the terms and conditions of the payday loan, including the interest rate, fees, repayment schedule, and consequences of late or missed payments.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Borrow Only What You Need</strong></p>\n<p>Only borrow the amount you need to cover your immediate expenses or emergencies.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Create a Repayment Plan</strong></p>\n<p>Develop a repayment plan to ensure that you can repay the loan on time and in full.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Budget Wisely</strong></p>\n<p>Create a budget that outlines your income, expenses, and financial goals.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Prioritise Loan Repayment</strong></p>\n<p>Make loan repayment a top priority to avoid late fees, penalties, and additional interest charges.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Avoid Rolling Over the Loan</strong></p>\n<p>Avoid the temptation to roll over or renew the payday loan, as it can lead to a cycle of debt and significantly increase the total cost of borrowing.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Build an Emergency Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Start <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/savings/step-by-step-guide-how-to-build-an-emergency-fund/\">building an emergency fund</a> to cover unexpected expenses and emergencies, so you won&#x27;t have to

Employee</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/payday-loans/how-to-apply-for-a-payday-loan-online/\">Taking out a payday loan</a> on your first paycheque can be a convenient way to address short-term financial needs, but it&#x27;s essential to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.</p>\n<p>Here are the pros and cons of taking out a payday loan on your first paycheck:</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>Quick Access to Funds</strong></p>\n<p>Payday loans typically offer <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/payday-loans/how-to-find-and-apply-for-the-best-payday-loans-in-nigeria/\">quick approval and funding</a>, allowing you to access cash on short notice. This can be beneficial if you have urgent expenses or unexpected emergencies.</p>\n<p>● <strong>No Credit Check Required</strong></p>\n<p>Many payday lenders do not require a traditional credit check, making them accessible to individuals with limited or poor credit history.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Minimal Documentation Required</strong></p>\n<p>Payday loans often have minimal documentation requirements compared to traditional loans, making the application process quick and straightforward.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Flexible Repayment Options</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, payday loans have short repayment terms, usually ranging from a few days to a few weeks.</p>\n<p>This can be beneficial if you only need funds temporarily and prefer to repay the loan quickly without a long-term commitment.</p>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>High Interest Rates</strong></p>\n<p>Payday loans are known for their high interest rates, which can be significantly higher than those of traditional loans. This can result in substantial finance charges and fees, increasing the overall cost of borrowing.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Short Repayment Terms</strong></p>\n<p>Payday loans typically require full repayment within a short period, often on your next payday. If you&#x27;re unable to repay the loan on time, you may face additional fees and penalties.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Risk of Debt Trap</strong></p>\n<p>Due to their high costs and short repayment terms, payday loans can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt.</p>\n<p>If you&#x27;re unable to repay the loan on time, you may be tempted to roll it over or take out another loan to cover the original amount, leading to a cycle of borrowing and indebtedness.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Limited Loan Amounts</strong></p>\n<p>Payday loans offer <a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/blog/loans/payday-loans/how-can-i-get-lower-interest-on-payday-loans/\">smaller loan amounts</a> compared to traditional loans, which may not be sufficient to cover larger expenses or financial emergencies.</p>\n<p>Depending on your financial needs, you may need to explore alternative sources of funding.</p>\n<p>Before taking out a payday loan as a new employee, carefully consider your financial situation, needs, and alternatives.</p>\n<p>Payday loans should be used as a last resort and approached with caution to avoid falling into a cycle of debt.</p>\n<p>Whether you are starting a new job or not, nairaCompare has you covered with our <a href=\"https://app.nairacompare.ng/loans/payday-loans\">wide array of payday loans</a> and other loan options.</p>\n<p><!-- strchf script --><script>if(window.strchfSettings === undefined) window.strchfSettings = {};window.strchfSettings.stats = {url: \"https://nairacompare.storychief.io/en/can-you-get-a-payday-loan-if-you-just-started-a-job-gfo4VVh9Fb8WhS?id=1218513896&type=2\",title: \"Can You Get a Payday Loan if You Just Started A Job?\",siteId: \"4702\",id: \"dd4301e4-fa02-4b1b-87c4-71a478c8464d\"};(function(d, s, id) {var js, sjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) {window.strchf.update(); return;}js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"https://d37oebn0w9ir6a.cloudfront.net/scripts/v0/strchf.js\";js.async = true;sjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sjs);}(document, 'script', 'storychief-jssdk'))</script><!-- End strchf script --></p>\n","raw":null},"excerpt":{"protected":false,"rendered":"<p>If you just started a job and need cash, obtaining a payday loan may be more challenging than you anticipate.

The key features that make fixed deposits attractive include predictable income, flexibility in choosing investment horizons, minimal maintenance once invested, and some tax benefits. However, the current economic climate in Nigeria characterized by double-digit inflation rates and fluctuating interest rates can negatively impact real returns for FD investors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d2dch\"><strong>Advantages of Fixed Deposits in Nigeria</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Guaranteed Returns Protect Income Predictability</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest allure of fixed deposits is that they offer assured returns unaffected by volatile stock market swings. This enables easy and accurate forecasting of interest income earned on maturity, making financial planning easier especially for retirees and pensioners. For instance, a 3-month fixed deposit from leading banks like <a href=\"https://www.gtbank.com/personal-banking/accounts/fixed-deposits\">GTBank promises up to 12.25%</a> gross interest per annum currently.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexibility in Tenors Aligns with Diverse Liquidity Needs</strong></p>\n<p>Investors get the flexibility to pick from tenure options ranging from 30 days to 5 years based on their liquidity needs and financial goals. <a href=\"https://www.fcmb.com/getfcmb/BD-Fat-Wallet.asp\">Short-term FDs maturing in 3-6 months</a> work well as emergency funds to cover unforeseen expenses while longer 24-60 month deposits allow disciplined wealth accumulation for specific objectives like higher education, weddings or house down payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimal Maintenance Appeals to Passive Investors</strong></p>\n<p>Once an investor locks the principal amount into a fixed deposit, it requires no further effort or monitoring apart from renewing or closing the deposit on maturity. This hassle-free nature with no forced involvement beyond the investment period appeals to passive investors who do not wish to track capital markets actively.</p>\n<p><strong>Tax Exempt Status Ups the Overall Post-Tax Yield</strong></p>\n<p>According to Nigeria&#x27;s tax code, interest income above ₦10,000 earned on fixed deposits is <a href=\"https://home.kpmg/ng/en/home/insights/2020/07/tax-treatment-of-investment-in-debt-instruments-in-nigeria.html\">exempt from local taxes</a>. This increases the overall post-tax yield delivered in investors&#x27; hands making FDs more tax-efficient compared to bonds or treasury bills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8psd2\"><strong>Disadvantages of Fixed Deposits in Nigeria</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Vulnerability to High Inflation Eats Away Real Returns</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest pitfall of fixed deposits is when the inflation rate outpaces the interest rate promised, the real rate of return on capital turns negative. This systematically erodes the purchasing power of investors. Currently, Nigeria&#x27;s inflation hovers above 15% while FD rates for terms under 2 years range between 5% to 12% making them unattractive to beat rising prices.</p>\n<p><strong>Premature Withdrawals Attract Huge Penalties</strong></p>\n<p>While investors can choose FDs aligned to their planned liquidity needs, unexpected financing needs can arise necessitating premature withdrawals. However, this flexibility comes at a huge cost in the form of penalty charges by banks &#8211; often slashing the total interest earned by 2-5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Bank Failure Risks Lead to Capital Losses</strong></p>\n<p>While rare, bank insolvencies due to issues like bad loans can turn out to be a risk for FD investors leading to potential delays in accessing funds or even capital losses in case of liquidation. For example, the 2018 liquidation of the failed <a href=\"https://nairametrics.com/2021/09/05/failed-bank-why-skye-bank-was-liquidated/\">Skye Bank</a> impacted numerous depositors and creditors.</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunity Cost of Forgone Higher Returns</strong></p>\n<p>Other savings instruments like stocks, mutual funds and real estate can generate much higher inflation-adjusted returns in the long run compared to fixed deposits. However, the underlying risk assumed is also higher in terms of capital loss. Still, this opportunity cost cannot be ignored by investors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6h00s\"><strong>Who Should Consider Fixed Deposits?</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Income-Seeking Investors Prioritizing Capital Preservation</strong></p>\n<p>For conservative investors like retirees and pensioners prioritizing capital protection and wealth preservation over high growth and risk, fixed deposits make for ideal vehicles delivering guaranteed regular payouts in the form of interest income.</p>\n<p><strong>Individuals with Short-Term Savings Goals</strong></p>\n<p>FDs serve well for those with financial goals maturing over the next 1-3 years like vacations, automobile purchases or accumulating funds for home down payments. The liquidity and returns can be forecasted accurately.</p>\n<p><strong>The Risk Averse Preferring Hassle-Free Investments</strong></p>\n<p>Low-risk individuals trying to keep up with inflation prefer FDs as they promise assured returns and guaranteed payouts unaffected by market downturns &#8211; making them ideal for capital preservation and portfolio diversification.</p>\n<p>Looking to invest in fixed deposits and you don’t know where to start? Start by comparing on <a href=\"https://app.nairacompare.ng/savings/fixed-deposit-account\">nairaCompare!</a></p>\n<p><strong>With nairaCompare, you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compare fixed deposits side-by-side:</strong> Find the best rates to match your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Filter and sort based on your preferences:</strong> You can filter based on your investment amount.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply directly for your chosen investment:</strong> Skip the hassle and save valuable time. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Don&#x27;t settle for the first fixed deposit you find.

Evaluating alternative investment avenues based on personalized financial situation, goals, timeframes and risk tolerance is key before locking savings in FDs.

With diverse business interests spanning from oil and gas to fashion and philanthropic initiatives, she has carved out a remarkable legacy as a self-made billionaire. Alakija&#x27;s lessons transcend personal and cultural boundaries, offering invaluable insights for anyone striving for financial success regardless of their circumstances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3g3e0\"><strong>Lesson 1: Spiritual Foundation</strong></h2>\n<p>At the core of Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s success lies a deep-rooted spiritual foundation that guides her business decisions and ethics. As a devout Christian, her faith serves as a moral compass, shaping her approach to wealth creation and wealth management. She believes that financial success should be pursued with integrity, compassion, and a commitment to uplifting others.</p>\n<p>Alakija&#x27;s spiritual beliefs have taught her the importance of balance, reminding her that true wealth extends beyond material possessions. While she remains dedicated to growing her business ventures, she also prioritizes giving back to her community through various philanthropic initiatives, such as the Rose of Sharon Foundation, which supports widows and orphans.</p>\n<p>By aligning her business practices with her faith-based principles, Alakija has demonstrated that it is possible to thrive financially while maintaining a strong ethical code. This balance between spiritual guidance and practical business strategy has been a driving force behind her sustained success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"79bul\"><strong>Lesson 2: Maximizing Time and Talent</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the key lessons from Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s journey is the importance of identifying and leveraging one&#x27;s unique strengths and passions. Early in her career, she recognized her talent for styling and fashion, which led her to establish an upscale fashion label, Supreme Stitches. This venture not only generated substantial revenue but also positioned her as a respected figure in the Nigerian fashion industry.</p>\n<p>Alakija&#x27;s ability to recognize and capitalize on her natural talents allowed her to make the most of her time and resources. She understood that true success often lies in aligning one&#x27;s pursuits with their innate abilities and passions, as this creates a sense of fulfillment and drives sustained motivation.</p>\n<p>To emulate this lesson, individuals should take the time to introspect and identify their unique strengths, whether they lie in creative pursuits, analytical thinking, leadership, or entrepreneurship. By focusing on areas where they excel, they can maximize their productivity and increase their chances of achieving financial success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bcdsk\"><strong>Lesson 3: The Power of Reputation</strong></h2>\n<p>In the business world, reputation is often considered more valuable than tangible assets. Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s unwavering commitment to integrity and delivering as promised has been instrumental in building her legacy as a trusted and respected figure in the Nigerian business community.</p>\n<p>From her early days as a fashion entrepreneur to her current role as the Executive Vice-Chairman of the Famfa Oil Limited, Alakija has consistently upheld the highest standards of professionalism and reliability. Her track record of keeping her word and delivering on her promises has not only earned her the trust of clients and partners but has also opened doors to new opportunities.</p>\n<p>Building a trustworthy and reliable brand involves consistently delivering high-quality products or services, maintaining transparency in business dealings, and fostering strong relationships with stakeholders. By prioritizing integrity and ethical practices, individuals can establish themselves as reputable and sought-after professionals or entrepreneurs, ultimately paving the way for long-term financial success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eomt0\"><strong>Lesson 4: Goal-Oriented Focus</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the hallmarks of Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s approach to financial success is her unwavering focus on setting and pursuing clear goals. From the outset of her entrepreneurial journey, she has understood the importance of defining both short-term and long-term financial objectives and aligning her efforts to achieve them.</p>\n<p>Alakija&#x27;s strategic goal setting has played a pivotal role in her ability to navigate the challenges and seize opportunities in the dynamic business landscape. By breaking down her overarching financial aspirations into tangible, achievable milestones, she has been able to maintain a clear sense of direction and prioritize her actions effectively.</p>\n<p>To apply this lesson, individuals should take the time to carefully define their financial goals, both in the short-term and long-term. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Once defined, it becomes easier to develop a roadmap and allocate resources effectively to achieve these objectives.</p>\n<p>For example, if an individual&#x27;s long-term goal is to achieve financial freedom by age 50, they may set short-term goals such as increasing their monthly savings by a certain percentage or investing in a diversified portfolio. By consistently working towards these milestones, they can steadily progress towards their ultimate financial aspirations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1s067\"><strong>Lesson 5: Continuous Learning</strong></h2>\n<p>In today&#x27;s rapidly evolving business landscape, the ability to adapt and stay ahead of the curve is crucial for sustained financial success. Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s commitment to continuous learning has been a driving force behind her ability to navigate challenges and seize new opportunities.</p>\n<p>Throughout her career, Alakija has embraced the mindset of a lifelong learner, constantly seeking out new knowledge and skills to enhance her business acumen. Whether it&#x27;s staying abreast of industry trends, mastering new technologies, or honing her leadership abilities, she recognizes that learning is an ongoing process.</p>\n<p>To cultivate a similar mindset, individuals should explore various avenues for acquiring new knowledge and skills. This could include taking courses, attending workshops or seminars, reading industry publications, or seeking mentorship from experienced professionals. Additionally, embracing a growth mindset and being open to constructive feedback can foster continuous improvement and personal growth.</p>\n<p>By making continuous learning a priority, individuals can stay relevant and adaptable in an ever-changing business environment, positioning themselves for long-term financial success and career growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a1onb\"><strong>Lesson 6: Resilience Against Discouragement</strong></h2>\n<p>Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s path to success has been marked by numerous challenges and setbacks, yet her ability to remain resilient in the face of discouragement has been a defining characteristic of her journey. From facing scepticism as a young entrepreneur in the male-dominated business world to navigating the complexities of the oil and gas industry, Alakija has encountered her fair share of obstacles.</p>\n<p>However, instead of allowing discouragement to derail her ambitions, she has harnessed it as a source of motivation. By maintaining an unwavering belief in her abilities and the validity of her goals, Alakija has consistently pushed through adversity and emerged stronger on the other side.</p>\n<p>To cultivate this resilience, individuals must adopt a mindset shift that reframes challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Rather than viewing setbacks as failures, they should be seen as valuable lessons that can inform future strategies and decisions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, surrounding oneself with a supportive network of mentors, peers, and loved ones can provide the encouragement and perspective needed to overcome moments of discouragement. By celebrating small wins and focusing on the long-term vision, individuals can maintain the motivation and perseverance necessary for lasting financial success.</p>\n<figure class=\"image strchf-type-image regular strchf-size-regular strchf-align-center\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://images.storychief.com/account_38892/folorunsho-2_3383783c389f1e3b2d409a1be48830bf_800.jpg 1x\" media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://images.storychief.com/account_38892/folorunsho-2_3383783c389f1e3b2d409a1be48830bf_800.jpg 1x\" media=\"(min-width: 769px)\" /><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"richest woman in nigeria\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.storychief.com/account_38892/folorunsho-2_3383783c389f1e3b2d409a1be48830bf_800.jpg\" /></picture></figure>\n<h2 id=\"bvg5f\"><strong>Lesson 7: Embracing Sacrifice</strong></h2>\n<p>Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s journey to becoming a billionaire has been marked by a willingness to make sacrifices and prioritize her financial goals over non-essential spending. She recognized that short-term sacrifices were necessary to achieve long-term gains, and she embraced this mindset wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p>Throughout her career, Alakija has made strategic trade-offs, forgoing immediate gratification in favor of investing in her businesses and securing her financial future. This commitment to delayed gratification has been a driving force behind her ability to accumulate wealth and maintain financial stability.</p>\n<p>To apply this lesson, individuals must be willing to prioritize their financial goals over non-essential expenses. This may involve temporarily reducing discretionary spending, delaying large purchases, or sacrificing certain luxuries in order to allocate resources towards savings, investments, or business ventures.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s important to reframe the concept of sacrifice as a temporary measure that will ultimately lead to greater long-term gains. By embracing a mindset of delayed gratification and remaining focused on the bigger picture, individuals can develop the discipline and resilience necessary to weather short-term challenges and achieve lasting financial success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"41iph\"><strong>Lesson 8: Calculated Risk-Taking</strong></h2>\n<p>While prudent financial management involves mitigating unnecessary risks, Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s journey also highlights the importance of calculated risk-taking. Throughout her career, she has strategically pursued opportunities that carried inherent risks but also promised significant rewards.</p>\n<p>Alakija&#x27;s approach to risk-taking has been guided by thorough research, careful analysis, and a deep understanding of the market dynamics. Rather than taking blind leaps of faith, she has embraced a methodical approach to assessing potential risks and weighing them against the potential rewards.</p>\n<p>One notable example of her calculated risk-taking was her decision to venture into the oil and gas industry, a male-dominated and highly competitive sector. By conducting extensive due diligence, securing strategic partnerships, and leveraging her entrepreneurial acumen, Alakija was able to navigate the risks and capitalize on the lucrative opportunities within the industry.</p>\n<p>To emulate this lesson, individuals should develop the ability to objectively assess risks and make informed decisions based on factual data and market insights. This may involve seeking expert advice, conducting market research, and developing contingency plans to mitigate potential risks.</p>\n<p>However, it&#x27;s important to strike a balance between caution and boldness. While excessive risk-taking can lead to devastating consequences, a complete aversion to risk may limit growth opportunities and stifle financial progress. By embracing calculated risks and remaining adaptable, individuals can position themselves to seize lucrative opportunities while minimizing potential downside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5gl0q\"><strong>Lesson 9: Learning from Failure</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite her remarkable success, Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s journey has been punctuated by failures and setbacks. However, rather than allowing these setbacks to define her, she has embraced them as valuable learning experiences that have shaped her growth and resilience.</p>\n<p>Alakija understands that failure is an inevitable part of the entrepreneurial journey and that the ability to learn from mistakes is crucial for long-term success. By analysing her failures objectively and identifying the root causes, she has been able to make necessary course corrections and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.</p>\n<p>To apply this lesson, individuals must normalize setbacks and reframe their perspective on failure. Rather than viewing it as a personal shortcoming, failure should be seen as an opportunity for growth and learning. By objectively analysing what went wrong and identifying areas for improvement, individuals can develop more effective strategies and increase their chances of success in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s important to cultivate a growth mindset and a willingness to take calculated risks. Those who embrace challenges and view failures as temporary setbacks are more likely to persist and ultimately achieve their financial goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bv4km\"><strong>Lesson 10: Persistence Pays Off</strong></h2>\n<p>Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s journey to becoming Nigeria&#x27;s richest woman is a testament to the power of persistence and unwavering dedication. From her humble beginnings as a secretary to her current status as a self-made billionaire, her story serves as an inspiration for anyone striving for financial success.</p>\n<p>Throughout her career, Alakija has faced numerous obstacles and setbacks, from skepticism and societal barriers to economic downturns and industry challenges. However, her persistence in the face of adversity has been a defining characteristic of her success.</p>\n<p>Alakija&#x27;s persistence has manifested in her relentless pursuit of her goals, her willingness to adapt and pivot when necessary, and her refusal to be deterred by temporary setbacks. She has consistently demonstrated that long-term dedication and a steadfast commitment to one&#x27;s vision can ultimately yield remarkable rewards.</p>\n<p>To emulate this lesson, individuals must cultivate the mindset of persistent action and commitment. This involves setting clear goals, developing a strategic plan, and consistently taking steps towards achieving those objectives, even in the face of challenges or discouragement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s important to embrace patience and trust the process. Sustainable financial success rarely occurs overnight; it often requires years of consistent effort, learning from failures, and making necessary adjustments along the way.</p>\n<p>By embodying the spirit of persistence and remaining unwavering in their pursuit of financial goals, individuals can increase their chances of achieving lasting success and realizing their full potential.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4mgec\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Folorunsho Alakija&#x27;s remarkable journey from humble beginnings to becoming Nigeria&#x27;s richest woman is a testament to the power of sound financial principles, resilience, and unwavering determination. Her lessons offer invaluable insights for individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their current financial circumstances.</p>\n<p>From cultivating a spiritual foundation and maximizing one&#x27;s talents to embracing continuous learning and calculated risk-taking, Alakija&#x27;s experiences highlight the importance of adopting a holistic approach to financial success. Additionally, her emphasis on integrity, goal-oriented focus, resilience against discouragement, and the willingness to make sacrifices and learn from failures serve as powerful reminders of the mindset required to navigate the often-challenging path to financial independence.</p>\n<p>As Alakija herself has said, &quot;Challenges are opportunities for growth, and the more you grow, the more you know, and the more you know, the more you can achieve.&quot; By adapting these lessons to their own unique circumstances and remaining persistent in the face of adversity, individuals can pave the way for lasting financial success and personal fulfilment.</p>\n<p>Learn from more successful Nigerian women<a href=\"https://nairacompare.ng/?s=okonjo\"> here! </a></p>\n<p>Want more content like this?

As the value of the Naira fluctuates against major currencies like the US Dollar, the purchasing power of Naira-denominated savings can erode rapidly. This situation has understandably raised questions about the wisdom of saving in the local currency, prompting many to explore alternative options.</p>\n<p>With inflation rates often reaching double digits, the real value of Naira savings can diminish alarmingly fast. For instance, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.nairacurrency.com/inflation-rate-in-nigeria\">NairaCurrency.com</a>, the inflation rate in Nigeria reached a staggering 21.47% in November 2022. This means that a Naira saved today would only be worth about 82% of its value a year later, significantly impacting long-term financial planning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3kfct\"><strong>The Challenges of Saving in Naira</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"5cg3j\"><strong>Inflation</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the primary challenges of saving in Naira is the persistent high inflation rate in Nigeria. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of the currency, which means that the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services over time. This phenomenon directly impacts the value of savings held in Naira.</p>\n<p>For example, let&#x27;s consider a scenario where you saved ₦1,000,000 in January 2020. With an average inflation rate of around 13% over the past three years, your savings would only be worth approximately ₦751,000 in real terms by January 2023. This erosion in purchasing power is a significant concern for individuals relying solely on Naira savings for their financial goals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5fh1o\"><strong>Devaluation</strong></h3>\n<p>Another challenge faced by those saving in Naira is the currency&#x27;s historical devaluation trend against major currencies like the US Dollar. Over the past decade, the Naira has consistently lost value against the Dollar, making imports more expensive and diminishing the purchasing power of Naira savings when it comes to acquiring foreign goods or services.</p>\n<p>According to the parallel market, the exchange rate between the Naira and the US Dollar has steadily increased from around ₦150 to $1 in 2010 to over ₦1500 to $1 as of February 2024. This devaluation means that a Naira saved today would be worth significantly less in terms of its US Dollar equivalent in the future, reducing the real value of long-term Naira savings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1eukp\"><strong>Alternatives to Saving in Naira</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"a15ap\"><strong>Dollar-Denominated Savings</strong></h3>\n<p>Given the challenges posed by inflation and devaluation, many Nigerians have explored alternatives to saving solely in Naira. One popular option is to hold a portion of savings in stable foreign currencies, such as the US Dollar. This approach provides a hedge against the depreciation of the Naira and can help preserve the purchasing power of savings over time.</p>\n<p>Opening and utilizing dollar-denominated accounts has become increasingly accessible in Nigeria. Several banks, including <a href=\"https://www.gtbank.com/personal-banking/ways-to-bank/foreign-currency-account\">Guaranty Trust Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.accessbankplc.com/pages/Personal-Banking/Foreign-Currency-Account.aspx\">Access Bank</a>, offer foreign currency accounts that allow customers to save and transact in US Dollars, Pounds Sterling, or other major currencies.</p>\n<p>By diversifying savings across multiple currencies, individuals can mitigate the risk of losing purchasing power due to Naira devaluation. However, it&#x27;s important to note that holding foreign currency accounts may come with additional fees and restrictions, so it&#x27;s essential to evaluate the terms carefully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4aimt\"><strong>Investments</strong></h3>\n<p>Another alternative to traditional Naira savings is investing in assets that have the potential to outpace inflation. Real estate, stocks, and treasury bills are among the popular investment options in Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Real estate investments, for instance, can provide a hedge against inflation as property values tend to appreciate over time. Similarly, investing in stocks of companies with strong fundamentals can generate returns that outpace the rate of inflation, albeit with higher risk.</p>\n<p>Treasury bills, issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria, offer relatively low-risk investment opportunities with returns typically higher than traditional savings accounts. However, it&#x27;s crucial to conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before venturing into any investment opportunity to ensure alignment with one&#x27;s risk tolerance and financial goals.</p>\n<p>Looking to invest in the Nigerian economy and you don’t know where to start?

Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) aim to maintain a stable value relative to the US Dollar, offering a digital alternative to holding physical dollars.</p>\n<p>To buy and store stablecoins, individuals can open accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, which facilitate the purchase and trading of various digital assets. However, it&#x27;s important to exercise caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, as the broader crypto market remains highly volatile and subject to significant price swings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aos4b\"><strong>Strategies for Mitigating Risk</strong></h2>\n<p>While exploring alternatives to saving solely in Naira can help mitigate the risks associated with inflation and devaluation, it&#x27;s crucial to adopt a well-rounded approach to manage your personal finances effectively. Here are some strategies to consider:</p>\n<h3 id=\"e01tr\"><strong>Diversification</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to manage risk is through diversification. Rather than putting all your savings into a single currency or investment vehicle, it&#x27;s generally advisable to spread your assets across different options. This could involve allocating a portion of your savings to Naira, another portion to dollar-denominated accounts, and investing the remaining funds in assets like real estate, stocks, or treasury bills.</p>\n<p>Diversification helps to reduce the overall risk by ensuring that your financial well-being is not entirely dependent on the performance of a single asset class or currency. It&#x27;s a time-tested strategy that can help weather economic storms and market fluctuations more effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"26h4k\"><strong>Staying Informed</strong></h3>\n<p>In today&#x27;s rapidly changing economic landscape, staying informed about relevant news and indicators is paramount. Regularly monitoring inflation rates, exchange rates, interest rates, and other economic data can provide valuable insights to guide your financial decisions.</p>\n<p>Reputable sources like <a href=\"https://nairametrics.com/?ref=nairacompare\">Nairametrics</a>and <a href=\"https://businessday.ng/?ref=nairacompare\">BusinessDay</a>offer up-to-date information and analysis on various economic indicators in Nigeria. By staying abreast of these developments, you can make more informed choices about where and how to allocate your savings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"40t3k\"><strong>Seeking Professional Advice</strong></h3>\n<p>While personal research and knowledge are invaluable, seeking professional advice from qualified financial advisors can provide an additional layer of guidance. Financial advisors have the expertise to evaluate your unique circumstances, risk tolerance, and goals, and can recommend tailored strategies to help you navigate the complexities of personal finance in Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Many banks and independent financial advisory firms offer personalized services to help individuals develop comprehensive financial plans, including guidance on savings, investments, and risk management strategies. While professional advice may come at a cost, it can be a worthwhile investment for securing your financial future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ecpm7\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The challenges posed by inflation and devaluation have raised valid concerns about the wisdom of saving solely in Naira. While the local currency remains a viable option for short-term savings and daily transactions, its long-term stability as a store of value is questionable.</p>\n<p>Exploring alternatives such as dollar-denominated savings, investments in assets like real estate and stocks, and even stablecoins can help mitigate the risks associated with Naira depreciation and erosion of purchasing power. However, it&#x27;s crucial to understand that each alternative comes with its own set of risks and considerations.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the key to effective financial planning in Nigeria lies in adopting a diversified approach, staying informed about economic developments, and seeking professional guidance when necessary. By being proactive and making informed choices, individuals can better navigate the complexities of personal finance and secure their financial well-being in the face of economic uncertainties.</p>\n<p>As the economic landscape continues to evolve, it&#x27;s essential to remain vigilant and adapt your savings and investment strategies accordingly. With the right mindset and tools, it is possible to preserve and grow your wealth, even in the face of currency volatility and economic challenges.</p>\n<p><!-- strchf script --><script>if(window.strchfSettings === undefined) window.strchfSettings = {};window.strchfSettings.stats = {url: \"https://nairacompare.storychief.io/en/dollar-naira?id=957899564&type=2\",title: \"Is it Still Safe to Save in Naira?\",siteId: \"4702\",id: \"dd4301e4-fa02-4b1b-87c4-71a478c8464d\"};(function(d, s, id) {var js, sjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) {window.strchf.update(); return;}js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"https://d37oebn0w9ir6a.cloudfront.net/scripts/v0/strchf.js\";js.async = true;sjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sjs);}(document, 'script', 'storychief-jssdk'))</script><!-- End strchf script --></p>\n","raw":null},"excerpt":{"protected":false,"rendered":"<p>The volatility of the Nigerian Naira has been a long-standing concern for many Nigerians, particularly when it comes to the security of their savings.
